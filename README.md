# Worker Attention Lapse for Industrial HRI

### Introduction

This dataset aims to foster affective computing in human attention, aka engagement, 
tracking in industrial Human-Robot Interaction settings. A multimodal sensing of 
manifold worker attention lapses are recorded and timestamp annotated in order to 
endow perception-cognition-action capabilities for robotic and autonomous agents.
